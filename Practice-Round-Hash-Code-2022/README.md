# Solving-One-Pizza-Practice Round-Hash-Code-2022-Using-Java

Creating a java programing oriented object for practice round hashcode 2022 problem with the simulated score board

# which approach did i used ?

I used the first agorithm to solve the inputs (a_an_example.in | b_basic.in)

The algorithm is :

1- Taking all the ingredient customers ( liked Ingredient and disliked Ingredient )

2- Removing any ingredient from choosed ingredient list which is inside desliked list ingredient customer

I solve the rest inputs(c_coarse.in | d_difficult.in | e_elaborate.in) by the second algorithm

The algorithm is :

1- Reordering customers list according to the disliked ingredient list (accending order)

2- If two disliked ingredient list customers has the same size , we will take the customer with the shortes liked list ingredient.

3- Taking all the ingredient liked list customers while there is no any disliked ingredient inside the taken list
